# Serla Handy paper holder

This is a simple two-part paper holder designed for paper towel stacks like Serla Handy and Lambi Home Towel. It holds the stack vertically and allows you to pull one sheet at a time from the top.

The model consists of two parts. The base holds the paper towel stack in place The lid rests on top of the stack with a central hole for dispensing. The lid provides light downward pressure to keep the stack aligned and should be printed with a dense infill (80+%) for added weight. This helps it stay in place when pulling out a sheet.

This model was designed in [Cadova](https://github.com/tomasf/Cadova), a Swift-based DSL for parametric 3D modeling. Also available on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1355930).
